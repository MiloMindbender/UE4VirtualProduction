# How to use the Virtual Production sample with your own Unreal projects.

I've created video guides on how to quickly combine your own unreal projects with my virtual production sample.  Please see [Use your own sets tutorial](https://youtu.be/trlpmm5gI6U) on my YouTube channel.

# Important reminders

Before you try and use your own Unreal maps and assets, please get my sample running on your hardware first.  You want to have a running example to make sure verything works before you start adding your own stuff!

Also, once you have this running example, remember to make a BACKUP COPY of it in case you make a mistake moving over your own assets.  The easiest way to do this is to use the "clone" function in the unreal launcher to make a copy under another project name.

# PLEASE report any problems.

If you run into any problems using your own assets, please report them as an issue here on github or on [my youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/GregCorson) and I'll try to help.
